				The Overwatch League was created in 2018 and started with their first season.<br>
				The popularity really grew fast and so the OWL had to build their buildings bigger.<br>
				Many fans from all over the world now could watch the OWL live in the stadium or live on twitch.<br>
				At their peek there were like 20 000 people live in the stadium and about 40 000 online watching the grand finals from 2019.<br>
